          <h1>About Calculate Overtime Pay</h1>

          <p>We built this overtime pay calculator from personal experience. We spent years working hourly retail and service jobs, where overtime was common—but understanding it wasn't. Figuring out whether an extra shift was worth it, how overtime would actually be calculated, or what a paycheck would look like often required guesswork or waiting until payday. Combined with our passion for building simple, useful websites, that frustration reminded us we can do something now. So we created this tool to make overtime clearer, faster, and easier to understand—so anyone can confidently know what they'll earn before saying yes to that extra shift.</p>

          <p>Our professional jobs have been in website creation and marketing, and we wanted to combine the 3 into 1: love of making things easier + values in helping others + professional skills = this website.</p>

          <h2>A part of the ads for Good network</h2>

          <p>This tool is built by <a href="https://www.ads4good.com/for-good" rel="noopener">Ads for Good</a>, a mission-led organization working to make the advertising industry more transparent and responsible. They focus on education and clarity around data and ads, helping businesses grow while keeping real people—not just profit—at the center.</p>
